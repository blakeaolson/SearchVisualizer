# Search Algorithm Visualizer

An application to demonstrate how effective each search algorithm is at finding its data. Users can visualize up to six different search algorithms as well as bubble sort, merge sort, and quick sort. In general, 1 ms delays were used for the sorting algorithms besides bubble sort. Bubble sort has a 10 second delay in the outer for loop for convenience in visualization.

## How it works
To use the Search Algorithm Visualizer, you must first sort the data. Most search algorithms require sorted input in order to be used. Therefore, three different sort algorithms are found at the bottom as well as an autosort option. The autosort toggle will automatically sort the data when you reset it. Once sorted, click any bar. If a bar is activated you may choose any search algorithm at the top to visualize it. To restart, click any other bar or reset the data.
